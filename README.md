<br> The project consisted of three main components<b></b>: <ol><li>Use javascript and d3 to load sample data <li> Use plotly to visualize data using bar charts, bubble charts and a gauge chart <li> Use d3 to allow users to select different subjects to analyze and have the graphical items update for each test subject </ol>
### Use javascript and d3 to load sample data: <br>
<ul>
  <li> Use the D3 library to read in samples.json from the URL
    <li> (https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json.)
  <li> Use d3 selectors to populate the drop down selector menu. Utilize javascript to test source data has been loaded correctly and validate results using the console log.
